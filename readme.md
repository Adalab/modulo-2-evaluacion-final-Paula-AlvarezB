# JavaScript test

This website is an element of assessment of Adalab web development bootcamp.
In order to show my command of JavaScript, I have created this website that allows the user to search anime series
in an API. The search results are displayed in a list that allows the user to clik each card in order to save series as favourites.
When clicked, the series are displayed in a new list of favourites and their appearance in the search results lists change.
In addition, the list of favourites is stored locally, so it is available after reloading the page.
The user can remove favourite elements both from the search results list and from the favourites list, individually, or as a whole.
